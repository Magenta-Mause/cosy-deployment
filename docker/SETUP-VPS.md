# VPS Setup Guide for Cosy Deployment

This guide walks you through setting up a fresh VPS for deploying Cosy with nginx, SSL, and Docker.

## Overview

- **One-time Setup**: Use Ansible to configure the VPS (security, nginx, SSL, Docker, secrets).
- **Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions handles all deployments via SSH.

## Prerequisites

- A fresh Ubuntu/Debian VPS (20.04 or newer)
- Root SSH access to the VPS
- A domain name pointed to your VPS IP
- Ansible installed locally (for initial setup only): `sudo apt install ansible`

## Part 1: Initial VPS Setup (One-Time, Uses Ansible)

This section uses Ansible to prepare your VPS. You only need to do this once per VPS.

### 1. Generate SSH Key for Deployment

This key will be used by you to SSH into the `deploy` user account, and by GitHub Actions to deploy the application.

```bash
# On your local machine
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/cosy_deploy -C "cosy-deployment"
```

### 2. Configure Variables

Set these environment variables in your local shell before running the setup playbook.

```bash
export DEPLOY_USER_SSH_KEY="$(cat ~/.ssh/cosy_deploy.pub)"
export COSY_DOMAIN="your.domain.com"
export LETSENCRYPT_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
```

### 3. Update Inventory

Edit `docker/ansible/inventory-setup.yml` and set `ansible_host` to your VPS IP address.
```yaml
ansible_host: 1.2.3.4 # Replace with your VPS IP
```

### 4. Run Setup Playbook

This command will configure the server. At the end, it will output the database credentials that you need for GitHub Secrets.

```bash
cd docker/ansible
ansible-playbook -i inventory-setup.yml setup-vps.yml
```

### 5. Configure GitHub Secrets

After the playbook finishes, it will display the `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`. Add these, along with the SSH key and server details, to your GitHub repository secrets at **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**.

Required GitHub Secrets:
- `VPS_HOST`: Your VPS IP address.
- `DEPLOY_USER`: The deployment username (the default is `deploy`).
- `VPS_SSH_KEY`: The **private** SSH key you generated (`cat ~/.ssh/cosy_deploy`).
- `POSTGRES_USER`: The database user, as generated by the Ansible playbook.
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: The database password, as generated by the Ansible playbook.

### 6. Test New User Access

You should now be able to SSH into the server as the `deploy` user with the key you generated.

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/cosy_deploy deploy@YOUR_VPS_IP
```

## What the Initial Setup Does

✅ **System Updates**: Updates all packages and enables automatic security updates.
✅ **User Management**: Creates a `deploy` user with passwordless sudo access, adds your SSH key, and hardens SSH security by disabling root and password-based logins.
✅ **Docker Installation**: Installs Docker Engine & Docker Compose and adds the `deploy` user to the `docker` group.
✅ **Firewall**: Configures UFW to allow only SSH (22), HTTP (80), and HTTPS (443) traffic.
✅ **Security**: Installs and configures `fail2ban` to protect against SSH brute-force attacks.
✅ **Nginx & SSL**: Installs and configures nginx as a reverse proxy, obtains a Let's Encrypt SSL certificate, and sets up automatic renewal.
✅ **Application Setup**: Creates the `/opt/cosy` directory, copies the `docker-compose.yml` file, and generates database secrets.

## Part 2: Automated Deployment (GitHub Actions)

After the initial setup, all deployments are handled automatically by the "Deploy to VPS" GitHub Actions workflow.

### How It Works

1.  Pushing to the `main` branch (or manually triggering the workflow) will start the deployment.
2.  The GitHub Actions workflow connects to your VPS via SSH.
3.  It copies the latest `docker/docker-compose.yml` file to `/opt/cosy/`.
4.  It pulls the latest Docker images for your application from the container registry.
5.  It runs `docker compose down -v` to stop and remove old containers and their associated volumes. **Note: This deletes all database data.**
6.  It starts the new application containers with `docker compose up -d`.

## Manual Deployment (Emergency/Testing)

If you need to deploy manually, bypassing GitHub Actions:

```bash
# 1. SSH into the VPS
ssh -i ~/.ssh/cosy_deploy deploy@YOUR_VPS_IP

# 2. Navigate to the deployment directory
cd /opt/cosy

# 3. If docker-compose.yml is outdated, copy the new version to the server
# On your local machine:
scp -i ~/.ssh/cosy_deploy docker/docker-compose.yml deploy@YOUR_VPS_IP:/opt/cosy/

# 4. On the VPS, set the required environment variables
export POSTGRES_USER="your_postgres_user_from_github_secrets"
export POSTGRES_PASSWORD="your_postgres_password_from_github_secrets"

# 5. Pull the latest images and restart the services
docker compose pull
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d

# 6. Check status and logs
docker compose ps
docker compose logs -f
```
